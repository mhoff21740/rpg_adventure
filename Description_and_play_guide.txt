RPG Adventure – A Procedural, Combat-Driven Dungeon Crawler Built in Python

RPG Adventure is a text-based, object-oriented dungeon crawler built from the ground up in Python. It showcases principles of game logic, combat systems, procedural generation, and modular design. Designed as a reinforcement project for mastering core Python fundamentals and object-oriented programming, the project blends clean architecture with engaging gameplay mechanics and emergent scenarios.

Game Highlights
•	Procedural Dungeon Generation
Each session generates a unique, interconnected dungeon map with variable room descriptions, secret discoveries, randomized NPCs, item placements, and strategic exit options. Previously visited rooms are tracked for immersive exploration.
•	Multi-Class Combat Engine
Players choose between class-based heroes (e.g. Wizard, Rogue, Ranger) with unique combat logic, resources, and class-specific mechanics:
o	Wizard unlocks new spells as they level.
o	Rogue strikes fast and favors agility-based tactics.
o	Ranger manages ranged combat through a finite arrow system with real-time inventory integration.
•	Intelligent Loot System
Looting adapts to player context and inventory—e.g., players need a fishing rod to catch a goldfish or arrows to benefit from ranged weapon drops. NPCs and other fallen players drop loot dynamically upon death.
•	Dynamic PvP & PvE Mechanics
Players can engage in combat with hostile NPCs or other player characters. NPCs scale in level and health relative to player progression, maintaining challenge throughout gameplay.
•	Stat-Driven Leveling System
Features a custom XP and level-up system modeled after Dungeons & Dragons 5e rules:
o	Level-gated ability score improvements
o	Class-based stat progression
o	Spell/skill unlocks based on player level
o	Player HP scaling
o	XP varies based on enemy type (NPC vs. player)
•	Boss Room Encounters
Unique boss rooms with special combat rules, secret modifiers, and strategic variation keep high-level encounters fresh and dangerous.
